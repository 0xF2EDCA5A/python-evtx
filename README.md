python-evtx
===========

Introduction
------------

python-evtx is a pure Python parser for recent Windows Event Log files (those with the file extension ".evtx").  The module provides programmatic access to the File and Chunk headers, record templates, and event entries.  The structure definitions and parsing strategies were heavily inspired by the work of Andreas Schuster and his Perl implementation "Parse-Evtx".

Background
----------
With the release of Windows Vista, Microsoft introduced an updated event log file format.  The format used in Windows XP was a circular buffer of record structures that each contained a list of strings.  A viewer resolved templates hosted in system library files and inserted the strings into appropriate positions.  The newer event log format is proprietary binary XML.  Unpacking chunks from an event log file from Windows 7 results in a complete XML document with a variable schema.  The changes helped Microsoft tune the file format to real-world uses of event logs, such as long running logs with hundreds of megabytes of data, and system independent template resolution.

Related Work
------------
Andreas Schuster released the first public description of the .evtx file format in 2007.  He is the author of the thorough document "Introducing the Microsoft Vista event log file format" that describes the motivation and details of the format.  Mr. Schuster also maintains the Perl implementation of a parser called "Parse-Evtx".  I referred to the source code of this library extensively during the development of python-evtx.

Joachim Metz also released a cross-platform, LGPL licensed C++ based parser in 2011.  His document "Windows XML Event Log (EVTX): Analysis of EVTX" provides a detailed description of the structures and context of newer event log files.
